This is managed by the program's call stack. \n\n#### Key Rule:\nAlways define your **Base Case** first, or you'll end up with the dreaded `StackOverflowError`!",

    content: "### The Speed of Development\n**Firebase** allows you to ship in days without a backend team. But as your data relationships grow, you might find the 'NoSQL' structure limiting.\n\n#### The Migration:\nMany startups start on Firebase and migrate to **PostgreSQL** once they need complex data integrity and cheaper long-term scaling.",

    content: "### Exploring Connections\n**Breadth-First Search (BFS)** is like a ripple in a pond—it finds the shortest path. **Depth-First Search (DFS)** is like a maze runner—it goes as deep as possible before turning back.\n\n#### When to use what:\nUse BFS for social network 'shortest paths'. Use DFS for checking if a path exists at all in a complex network.",
